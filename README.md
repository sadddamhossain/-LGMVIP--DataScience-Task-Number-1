# Iris  flowers classification ML project Letsgrow
The steps for an Iris flowers classification machine learning project:

1. **Data Collection:** Obtain the Iris flowers dataset, which contains samples of three different species of Iris flowers, each described by sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Perform any necessary data cleaning, handling missing values, and removing duplicates.

3. **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Explore the dataset to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships between features using plots and statistics.

4. **Feature Selection/Extraction:** Choose relevant features for the classification task or perform feature extraction techniques if necessary.

5. **Data Splitting:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.

6. **Model Selection:** Select a classification algorithm (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, etc.).

7. **Model Training:** Train the selected model on the training data.

8. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

9. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters to improve its performance.

10. **Model Deployment:** Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

After that i build my ML model successfully
